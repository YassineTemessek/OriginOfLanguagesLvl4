# OriginOfLanguagesLvl4 (LV4)

LV4 is the **theory + validation blueprint** for the broader project. It builds on LV3 outputs (ranked leads + QA) and defines how to move from discovery to stricter hypothesis testing.

## Start Here

- Main document (GitHub-friendly): `Master FoundationV3.2.md`

## Repo Contents

- `Master FoundationV3.2.md`: the main LV4 document (preferred).
- `docs/`: supporting notes, templates, and an execution roadmap.

## How LV4 relates to LV3

- LV3 (runnable pipeline): ingest + similarity scoring + ranked candidate discovery + QA reports.
- LV4 (this repo): hypotheses, constraints, corridor catalog, anchor policy, and a validation track design.

If you want to run code and generate ranked leads, start with LV3:
