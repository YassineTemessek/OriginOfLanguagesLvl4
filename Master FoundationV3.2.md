Rewriting Language History Through Deep Root Analysis, Anchored Lemmas, and AI-Tracked Sound Structures
Authoring Mode: Discovery-First (recall-maximizing, non-restrictive) with a dormant Validation Track

## 0. Executive Summary


This program explores whether ancient Semitic root systems-especially East and Northwest Semitic, Old Arabic epigraphy, and Qur'ānic Arabic-show systematic structural correspondences with attested Indo-European lexica beyond chance.

We will discover first and decide later:

Track A - Discovery (active):
Find, rank, and narrate similarities; keep everything attested; avoid premature filters; allow a brute lemma layer as long as it is explicitly tagged.

Track B - Validation (designed, dormant):
Once Discovery stabilizes, apply chronology locks, rule-constrained paths, null models, and publication-grade tests on a clean, attested anchor layer.

New in v3.2 we introduce:

A lemma anchor policy (starting with Latin as the first cross-family anchor language).

Explicit lemma metadata fields (lemma_form, lemma_pos, lemma_status, lemma_source).

A Brute Lemma Layer for early discovery (auto_brut status), quarantined from formal evidence.

Updated KPIs that track anchor coverage and anchor quality before Validation is activated.

This document fixes the language scope, English-forward concept modeling, anchor lemma policy, schemas, corridors, and a rapid candidate pipeline to scale discovery responsibly.

### 0.1 LV3 Implementation Notes (Code + Artifacts)

This Master Foundation document is the LV4 theory + validation blueprint.
The runnable discovery pipeline lives in LV3: `C:/AI Projects/LinguisticComparison LV3/`.

LV3 produces (local, not committed by default):
- Canonical processed lexeme tables: `data/processed/...`
- Ranked leads + QA artifacts: `outputs/`
- Run manifests (what ran, outputs present): `outputs/manifests/`

Key LV3 entrypoints:
- Build/refresh processed data: `python "scripts/ingest/run_ingest_all.py"`
- Validate processed outputs: `python "scripts/ingest/validate_processed.py" --all`
- Run discovery retrieval + hybrid scoring (recommended): `python "scripts/discovery/run_discovery_retrieval.py" --source ... --target ...`
- Optional legacy matcher: `python "scripts/discovery/run_full_matching_pipeline.py"`

LV3 discovery technologies (current):

- **SONAR (Meta)**: multilingual semantic similarity (meaning) in a shared embedding space.
- **CANINE (Google)**: character-level similarity (form) over raw Unicode.
- **Hybrid scoring (LV3)**: after retrieval, compute additional rough component scores (orthography / IPA / skeleton) and a combined exploratory score for ranking.
- **MMS (Meta, optional later)**: speech-centric representation for phonetic similarity and audio rendering; treated as an extra signal, not evidence by itself.

LV4 uses LV3 outputs as the discovery corpus and then applies stricter constraints (anchors, chronology, null models) in the Validation Track.

## 1. Core Principles


Discover, don't decide.
Early work maximizes recall. No deletions-only ranking and tagging.

Attested only (for evidence).
No Proto reconstructions counted as data (they may be cited in notes).
Brute-filled lemma anchors are allowed for UI & exploratory navigation but explicitly tagged.

Multi-view evidence.
Compare semantic similarity (SONAR), form similarity (CANINE), and classic views like consonantal skeletons / ORT-like traces / IPA-driven signals when available.

Transparent provenance.
Every form carries stage, script, date window, source, and now lemma_status & lemma_source.

English-forward with anchor languages.
English appears as real data across stages (Old -> Middle -> Early Modern -> Modern) and is the user-facing anchor, while Latin serves as the first cross-family lemma anchor language.

Meaning is layered.
Concepts can surface via synonyms, part-whole (meronym/holonym), and figurative paths (metonymy/synecdoche), especially in Semitic.

Anchors before claims.
Before making strong historical claims, lemma anchors for key languages must reach defined coverage/quality thresholds.

## 2. Hypotheses (Exploratory Framing)


H1-E (Exploratory Correlation):
Recurrent overlaps appear across views for stable concepts.

H2-E (Directionality Unfixed):
Direction and pathways remain open; log chronology/contact hints without enforcing them.

H3-E (Orthographic Echo):
ORT (silent letters, digraphs, fossil clusters) often improves discovery ranking.

H4-E (Corridors):
"Sound corridors" are catalogued as soft tendencies, not certified laws.

(These elevate to strict H1-H4 only after Discovery Corpus v1.0 is frozen.)

## 3. Language Scope - v2.2 (Condensed, Attested, Final)

### A) Semitic - Core Ancient & Classical


Akkadian (Old/Standard Babylonian & Assyrian)

Eblaite

Ugaritic

Imperial Aramaic (with Biblical Aramaic encompassed in the same lexical layer)

Biblical Hebrew

Phoenician (incl. Punic/Neo-Punic)

Old Arabic epigraphy: Safaitic, Hismaic, Dadanitic/Taymanitic

Qur'ānic / Classical Arabic

Sabaic (Old South Arabian)

Geʿez (Classical Ethiopic)

### B) Semitic - Modern & Dialect Continua (specific, non-generic)


Egyptian (Cairene) * Saʿīdi (Upper Egypt)

Najdi (Saudi, central) * Ḥijāzi (Saudi, western)

Iraqi (Baghdad) * Syrian (Damascus) * Lebanese (Beirut)

Tunisian (Derja) (sole Maghrebi per policy) * Yemeni (Ṣanʿānī)

Maltese (Semitic lexicon in Latin script; prime ORT catalyst)

Classical Syriac * Turoyo (Neo-Aramaic, Ṭūr ʿAbdīn) * Modern Hebrew

Mehri * Soqotri * Amharic

### C) Indo-European - Core Ancient & Early (attested only)


Hittite

Mycenaean (Linear B) * Classical Greek (Attic/Ionic)

Latin (first lemma anchor language)

Gothic * Old English

Old Irish

Old Prussian

Old Church Slavonic (Glagolitic/Cyrillic)

Vedic Sanskrit * Pāli (Prakrit)

Avestan * Old Persian (cuneiform)

Classical Armenian

### D) English Continuity (experience + ORT)


Middle English

Early Modern English

Modern English

(Old English is in section C but forms part of the English historical chain.)

Inclusion / Exclusion

Attested only; no umbrella labels (e.g., "Levantine," "Gulf"), no reconstructed Proto forms.

Orthography policy

Store raw script + scholarly transliteration + IPA; preserve fossil segments for ORT.

3bis) Lemma Policy & Language Anchors (New in v3.2)

For each concept and language, we maintain lemma anchors with explicit metadata.

Per-language lemma fields:

lemma_form - canonical citation form (with diacritics where standard).

lemma_pos - part of speech (N, V, ADJ, ADV, etc.).

lemma_status - one of:

"gold" - fully attested, verified via authoritative dictionary/grammar.

"silver" - attested but with residual sense ambiguity or register uncertainty.

"auto_brut" - automatically generated or heuristic "best guess"; allowed in Discovery but quarantined from Validation.

lemma_source - dictionary/grammar reference, or "heuristic" for brute-derived entries.

Anchor languages (initial set):

Latin (lat) - first cross-family anchor language; stored in a dedicated lat_lemma field and in generic anchor structures.

Subsequent anchor sets will be defined for Classical Greek, Hittite, etc., following the same policy.

Usage rules

Discovery Track

All lemma anchors may appear in UI, exploratory tables, and light semantic gating.

Only gold/silver anchors can be used as positive evidence in pattern narratives.

auto_brut anchors can guide exploration but must be explicitly recognized as provisional.

Validation Track

Only gold and (carefully documented) silver anchors are admitted into formal statistical tests and historical arguments.

auto_brut entries must be either upgraded or excluded from evaluation datasets before use.

Multiple lemma options

When a concept has more than one plausible lemma (e.g., ROAD: via vs iter in Latin), pick one as the primary lemma with lemma_status: "gold" and list others in notes and/or as secondary anchors.

## 4. Concept Inventory - v2.2 (Final)


Ready-to-use inventory of 536 base concepts across 21 categories with Priority Tiers:

Tier A: core

Tier B: daily life

Tier C: extended

Download artifacts

CSV: lexical_concepts_v2_2.csv

JSONL: lexical_concepts_v2_2.jsonl

Seeding quotas per concept (Discovery phase)

Semitic Ancient/Core: >= 4 forms

Semitic Modern/Dialects: >= 5 forms

Prefer Tunisian, Cairene, Saʿīdi, Najdi, Ḥijāzi, Iraqi, Syrian, Lebanese, Yemeni, Maltese.

IE Ancient/Early: >= 6 forms

Ensure Hittite, Greek (Mycenaean/Classic), Latin, one Germanic, one Indo-Aryan, one Iranian, plus one from Old Irish / Old Prussian / OCS / Armenian.

## 5. Concept Modeling: Synonyms, Part-Whole, Figuratives (English-Forward)

### 5.1 What we encode


Synset (English):
Core lemma + near-synonyms (e.g., EYE -> eye, eyeball), with register/frequency flags.

Meronyms & Holonyms:
Parts like iris, pupil, cornea; wholes like face, head.

Figurative links:
Metonymy/synecdoche widely attested in Semitic (e.g., عين ʿayn "eye" -> "spring (of water)", "spy/agent").
These are allowed in Discovery with penalties and explicit tags.

### 5.2 Expansion policy during Discovery


Radius 0 (default): literal sense only.

Radius 1: allow synset/meronym with a light penalty (-10% semantics, -0.2 composite) and tag.

Radius 2: allow figuratives (metonymy/synecdoche) with stronger penalty (-25% semantics, -0.5 composite) and a figurative tag.

(Radius toggles are per notebook; nothing is forced.)

## 6. Data Schemas (Minimal yet Extensible)


Implementation note (LV3):
The current LV3 pipeline stores a minimal shared schema for lexemes (e.g., `id`, `lemma`, `language`, `stage`, `script`, `source`, `lemma_status`, plus `ipa`/`ipa_raw` and optional `pos`/`translit`).
Derived views (skeleton/ORT/feature vectors) may be computed during matching rather than stored in every lexeme row.

id: CORRIDOR_GUTTURAL_01
name: "k-x-h-Ø corridor"
attested_examples:
  - "OE niht > Eng night (l-gh-t fossil class parallel)"
  - "Arabic ḫ weakening > h in specific dialect continua"
notes: "Soft tag in discovery; chronology enforced only in Validation Track."

```


Required fields (lexeme)
id, language, stage, script, date_window, orthography, ipa, skeleton, vowel_matrix, syllable_template, ort.trace, ort.flags, gloss, concept_id, sense_id, register, mapping_type, lemma_anchor, provenance, notes

## 7. Representations (Three Views)


Skeleton View (C-only)
Consonantal sequence; bigram/trigram shingles; permissive about epenthesis/gemination in Discovery.

ORT View (Orthography-as-is)
Preserve silent letters, digraphs, archaic clusters.
English is especially valuable: kn-, wr-, gh, ps-, pt-, mn-.
Script-switch languages (Maltese, Judeo-Arabic, Bactrian) amplify ORT signals.

Articulatory-Sonority View
Feature vectors (place, manner, voicing, emphatic/pharyngealization) and a whole-word sonority profile curve.

Vowel matrices and syllable templates are stored and down-weighted, used when stabilizing patterns.

## 8. Discovery Corridors (Soft, Tagged)


Guttural: k <-> x <-> h <-> Ø; q/ḳ <-> k/g

Spirantization: p <-> f <-> ph; t <-> θ <-> s; d <-> ð <-> z

Liquid: r <-> l (rhotacism/lateralization)

Labialization: b <-> v <-> w; gʷ <-> w

Palatal-sibilant: s <-> š <-> sh <-> ch/tsch

Velar-palatal: k/g <-> č/j/y under front-vowel pressure

Nasal: m <-> n (assimilation/cluster repair)

Glottal/Vowel repair: ʔ <-> vowel insertion/lengthening; ḥ/ʕ -> h/Ø

Cluster memory: kn-, gn-, wr-, ps-, pt-, mn- persist in spelling after phonetic simplification

(Store as tags; no hard enforcement in Discovery.)

## 9. Rapid Candidate Generation (RCG) Pipeline


Ingest & Normalize (LV3)

- Convert raw sources into canonical `data/processed/...` tables.
- Preserve provenance and stage/script labels.
- When present, keep `ipa`/`ipa_raw` and transliteration fields for later scoring.

Retrieval-first discovery (LV3)

- **SONAR retrieval**: semantic similarity across languages (meaning neighbors).
- **CANINE retrieval**: character-level similarity across scripts (form neighbors).
- Candidates are the union of SONAR and CANINE top‑K lists (high recall).

Hybrid scoring (LV3, exploratory)

- Compute additional rough component scores on retrieved pairs:
  - orthography (n-grams + string ratio; prefers translit if available)
  - sound (IPA similarity when present)
  - skeleton (consonant skeleton similarity)
- Produce an exploratory combined score used for ranking and inspection.

Triaging & Tagging

- Keep discovery tags soft: corridor hints, script/stage notes, loan flags, chronology notes, lemma_status_* fields.
- Nothing deleted; low-score leads are parked, not pruned.

### 9.7 Brute Lemma Layer (New in v3.2)


During early Discovery, some lemma fields may be automatically generated / Latinized:

All such entries are tagged with lemma_status: "auto_brut" and lemma_source: "heuristic".

They may be:

Used for UI display, quick navigation, and rough semantic anchoring.

Excluded from corridor stats and motif arguments unless manually checked.

The scoring engine must not treat auto_brut anchors as positive historical evidence.

Before Validation Track activation, every auto_brut anchor is either:

Upgraded to gold / silver (attested, documented), or

Excluded from evaluation datasets.

## 10. Pattern Atlas (Living, Narrative-First)


Cluster recurrent patterns into motifs (e.g., liquid alternation in kinship, guttural corridor in fire/heat, cluster echoes in tools).

Each motif entry contains:

Top leads

Short narrative

Key corridors

Scripts involved

Paradox notes

"Next-up languages"

## 11. Visual Analytics (Exploration Aids)


Discovery heatmaps: concept × language-pair scores.

Corridor chord diagrams: corridor usage across families.

Timeline sparklines: earliest attestations vs. lead density.

Neighborhood maps: UMAP / t-SNE over articulatory vectors.

Chart grammar guidelines:

Axes and scales must be documented.

Colors carry consistent meaning (e.g., language families, corridor types).

"Red flag" views highlight:

Chronology violations

Corridor overuse

Over-reliance on auto_brut anchors

(Interpretive tools only-claims wait for Validation.)

## 12. Data Architecture


Implementation note:
- LV3 (runnable pipeline) uses a repo layout under `LinguisticComparison LV3/`:
- `data/raw/...` inputs (local)
- `data/processed/...` canonical tables (local)
- `resources/...` tracked reference assets (concepts, anchors)
- `scripts/ingest/...` ingest + utilities
- `scripts/discovery/...` matching + scoring
- `outputs/...` and `outputs/...` run artifacts (local)

Conceptual architecture (for LV4 planning):
/data
  /raw/{language}/{source}/...
  /processed/{tables}.jsonl
/schemas
  lexeme.schema.json
  lead.schema.json
  concept.schema.json
  corridor_card.schema.yaml
  anchor.schema.json
/src
  /ingest  /align  /nn  /score  /viz
/notebooks
/docs

## 13. English Curation Rules


Seed four stages: Old, Middle, Early Modern, Modern-so users see real English and ORT fossils.

Prefer literal sense_id:
Add figuratives as separate lexemes under the same concept_id with mapping_type: "metonymy" | "synecdoche".

Mark register:
Dialectal, archaic, colloquial, technical. Keep low-frequency items if they clarify part-whole mappings (eyeball).

Never collapse figuratives into literal:
Keep them but down-weight with Radius-2 penalties.

English + Latin as front row:
English remains the primary user-facing language, while Latin anchors serve as a cross-family pivot for many concepts. Both appear prominently in UI and analytics.

## 14. Governance (Discovery-Mode)


Explorers
Run searches, score leads, write motif notes.

Curators
Enforce attestation quality, stage/script integrity, schema consistency.

Anchor Curators (new)

Upgrade auto_brut lemma anchors to gold / silver.

Validate lemmas against grammars/dictionaries.

Maintain per-language lemma guidelines (verb principal parts, gender, irregular plurals).

Mapmakers
Produce dashboards, heatmaps, and motif galleries, with red-flag views for potential overinterpretation.

Chroniclers
Capture paradoxes, hunches, and anomalies succinctly in a Paradox Registry.

Daily stand-ups report patterns found, motifs emerging, coverage gaps, and anchor upgrades-not verdicts.

## 15. Milestones & KPIs (0-90 Days)

Days 0-10

Lock scope (this document).

Seed Tier-A concepts first:

Prepare Validation Track checklist.

KPIs

Coverage KPIs

concept_language_coverage: % of concepts × languages meeting minimal lexeme quotas.

lead_density: average number of leads per concept above a DiscoveryScore threshold (e.g. DS >= 6.0).

motif_count: number of motifs with cross-family support.

corridor_diversity: distribution of corridor tags across leads.

Anchor KPIs (new)

lemma_anchor_coverage_lat: % of concepts with a non-empty Latin lemma anchor.

lemma_anchor_confidence_lat: proportion of Latin lemmas with lemma_status: "gold" | "silver" vs. auto_brut.

Suggested gate before Validation activation:

lemma_anchor_coverage_lat >= 90%

lemma_anchor_confidence_lat (gold+silver) >= 70%

ORT uplift KPI

ort_uplift_frequency: proportion of leads where ORT view improves ranking vs skeleton-only.

KPIs must be tracked per sprint and explicitly reported before moving to Validation.

## 16. Validation Track (Designed, Dormant)


Activate after Discovery Corpus v1.0 is frozen and anchor KPIs are met.

Validation includes:

Chronology locks and contact windows.

Rule-constrained paths (Grimm, Verner, High German shift, Sanskrit -> Prakrit, Avestan -> Middle Persian, Semitic emphatic softening / loss of pharyngeals, etc.).

Permutation tests with phonotactic-matched nulls and FDR control.

Loan filters that exclude (not just tag).

Anchor cleanliness:

Use only gold and carefully documented silver anchors for formal tests.

Exclude or separately model any residual auto_brut items.

Pre-registration and publication workflow.

## 20. Close


This v3.2 Master Foundation Document is the operative baseline for the project.

It keeps Discovery wide and English-forward, introduces a lemma anchor system with Latin as the first anchor language, encodes synonyms and part-whole structure, respects Semitic figurative usage, and preserves the orthographic fossils that power ORT.

Nothing is prematurely filtered; all evidence is ranked, tagged, anchored, and narrated.
When Discovery Corpus v1.0 is frozen and anchor KPIs are satisfied, the Validation Track will be activated to rigorously test what endures.

## 21. Appendix A - Latin Anchor Style Guide (v1.0)


Stage
Use Classical Latin (roughly late Republic-early Empire) as the default temporal frame.

Citation forms

Nouns in nominative singular (aqua, ignis, manus, cor).

Verbs in the 1st principal part (ire, videre, dicere, amare).

Adjectives in masculine nominative singular (bonus, magnus, novus).

Concept vs lemma type

Concepts primarily actions/states (GO, SEE, SAY, LIVE) -> verbs.

Concepts primarily entities/events (DEATH, BIRTH, HOUSE) -> nouns.

If both are central, choose the more cross-linguistically comparable and record alternates in notes.

Polysemy and multiple candidates

If a concept can map to several Latin lemmas (e.g., ROAD: via vs iter), designate one as the primary lemma (gold) and treat others as secondary, documented in notes and/or additional anchors.

Sense discipline

Keep anchors Radius-0 literal unless the concept is explicitly figurative.

Do not let idiomatic/figurative Latin choices stand for literal concepts unless clearly flagged.

Morphology & gender

Always record grammatical gender and full dictionary information in notes where relevant (e.g., manus, -us (f.)).

Where irregular plurals or stem changes exist (os/ossis, dens/dentis), document them in notes.

Status progression

Default brute-filled anchors start as lemma_status: "auto_brut".

Once checked against a reliable dictionary/grammar, upgrade to silver or gold.

gold implies both attestation and clear sense alignment with the concept definition.

Orthographic choices

Use macrons where helpful (sōl, lūna, ūnus) in internal data.

Maintain a parallel ASCII-safe representation where needed for tooling.

Loanwords & later forms

Avoid Medieval or later Latin unless the concept is explicitly temporally anchored there.

For obviously borrowed or late forms, tag with loan_flag: true and consider them separate from core Classical anchors.

Change control

Any systematic change to Latin lemma choices should be versioned (e.g., Latin Anchor Set v1.1) and propagated via scripts (not manual edits) to keep the pipeline reproducible.
