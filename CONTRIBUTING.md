## What to change here

- Improve clarity and structure in `Master FoundationV3.2.md`
- Add supporting docs under `docs/`
- Add templates (concept/lexeme/lead/corridor cards) under `docs/templates/`

## Style guidelines

- Prefer short sections and explicit headings.
- Keep claims separate from evidence plans.
- When adding a new policy/rule, include:
  - why it exists
  - how it is tested (or how it will be tested in validation)
  - what would falsify it

## Versioning policy

- Do not overwrite the meaning of an existing “vX.Y” Master Foundation.
- Create a new file for major revisions (e.g., `Master FoundationV3.3.md`) and link it from `README.md`.
