# Corridors (Soft Correspondence Tags)

Corridors are discovery-friendly *tags* representing common phonological “paths” (tendencies), not certified laws.

## Discovery mode

- Corridors are tags only.
- They may boost ranking slightly but must not force matches.
- Corridor overuse is a “red flag” in QA reporting.

## Validation mode

- Corridors become explicit, testable correspondence rules.
- Rules must be justified per language family and stage.

## Corridor cards

Use the corridor card template to define:

- an id and name
- a short description
- attested examples (with sources)
- notes/limitations

Template: `docs/templates/corridor_card.yaml`
